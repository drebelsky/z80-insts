This was written using Python 3.12.7, on a Linux environment with `wget`, but should work for most recent versions of Python and on most Unix-like systems. The `Makefile` isn't very complex and is mainly helpful when making changes, so if you are lacking `make` (or `wget`), it should be pretty easy to fix.

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ make
```
